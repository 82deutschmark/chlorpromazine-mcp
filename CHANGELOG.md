# Changelog

All notable changes to the Chlorpromazine MCP Server project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08-19
*Claude Code (Claude Sonnet 4) - Complete Refactor*

### 🚀 MAJOR REFACTOR - Complete Architecture Overhaul

**This release represents a complete rewrite of the Chlorpromazine MCP Server, transforming it from a 588-line monolithic security risk into a secure, modular, production-ready system.**

### ✨ **Phase 1: Modular Architecture**
- **BREAKING**: Restructured entire codebase into modular architecture
- Split monolithic `server.ts` into focused modules:
  - `src/config/` - Environment validation and constants
  - `src/handlers/` - MCP protocol handlers (tools, prompts, messages)
  - `src/services/` - Rate limiting, SerpAPI client, file reader
  - `src/tools/` - Modular tool implementations
  - `src/prompts/` - MCP prompt implementations
  - `src/types/` - Clean TypeScript type definitions
  - `src/utils/` - Security utilities and structured logging
- Achieved proper separation of concerns and single responsibility principle
- Eliminated all `any` types for complete type safety

### 🔒 **Phase 2: Security Hardening**
- **NEW**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation using Zod schemas
- **NEW**: Rate limiting service with sliding window algorithm
- **NEW**: Timeout protection on all network requests (5s SerpAPI timeout)
- **NEW**: Secrets masking in file operations (environment variables hidden)
- **NEW**: Request size limits (1MB max) to prevent DoS attacks
- **NEW**: CORS configuration and security headers
- **NEW**: Error message sanitization (stack traces hidden in production)
- **NEW**: File path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks

### 🎯 **Phase 3: Complete MCP Implementation**
- **FIXED**: Critical bug where prompts handlers weren't being registered
- **NEW**: Full implementation of all 3 MCP prompts:
  - `sober_thinking` - Ground agent in project reality
  - `fact_checked_answer` - Verify answers against documentation  
  - `buzzkill` - Debug systematic issues with structured analysis
- **FIXED**: Proper JSON-RPC protocol compliance with correct headers
- **NEW**: Complete MCP method support: `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `sampling/createMessage`

### 🧪 **Phase 4: Test Suite Overhaul**
- **FIXED**: Updated tests from REST endpoints to proper MCP JSON-RPC protocol
- **NEW**: Proper MCP client implementation with correct headers (`Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`)
- **FIXED**: Test infrastructure to use modular server architecture

### 🐛 **Critical Bug Fixes**
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed package.json to run new modular server (`dist/src/server.js`) instead of old monolithic version
- **FIXED**: Handler registration now works correctly - all handlers (tools, prompts, messages) register successfully
- **FIXED**: Environment validation no longer prevents handler imports
- **FIXED**: MCP protocol compliance - server properly handles initialization and method calls

### 🔧 **Technical Improvements**
- **NEW**: Structured logging with timestamps and context
- **NEW**: Graceful shutdown handling with proper cleanup
- **NEW**: Health check endpoint with comprehensive system status
- **NEW**: Development mode with enhanced debugging
- **IMPROVED**: TypeScript configuration for better development experience
- **IMPROVED**: Build process optimization

### 📚 **Documentation Updates**
- **UPDATED**: README.md with complete feature documentation
- **NEW**: Security features section
- **UPDATED**: MCP protocol documentation
- **UPDATED**: Installation and deployment guides

### ⚠️ **Breaking Changes**
- Server entry point changed from `dist/server.js` to `dist/src/server.js`
- Configuration validation now strictly enforces required environment variables
- Tool input validation may reject previously accepted malformed inputs
- API responses format improved for better MCP compliance

### 🎉 **Benefits After Refactor**
- **Security**: Complete protection against injection attacks, DoS, and data leaks
- **Maintainability**: Modular design allows independent testing and updates
- **Compliance**: Full MCP protocol implementation with all advertised capabilities
- **Performance**: Optimized request handling with rate limiting and timeouts
- **Reliability**: Proper error handling and graceful degradation
- **Scalability**: Architecture ready for production deployment

*This refactor addresses all critical security vulnerabilities and architectural issues identified in the comprehensive audit, making the server production-ready.*

## [0.4.4] - 2025-05-28
*GPT-4.1 (Cascade)*

### Changed
- Updated the descriptions for the `kill_trip` and `sober_thinking` tools in both server.ts and README.md.
- Tool descriptions now include natural language triggers and explicit guidance for use when the user is upset, questioning the agent, or indicating hallucination.
- README updated to accurately document tool usage and triggers for LLMs and users.

## [0.4.3] - 2025-05-18
*Claude 3.5 Sonnet*

### Changed
- Completed robust refactor for MCP SDK v1.11.4 alignment.
- All MCP request handlers now use strict parameter shapes and enforce type safety with defensive type guards.
- Added fallback logic for the `model` field to guarantee a string value (`DEFAULT_ASSISTANT_MODEL` if needed).
- All TypeScript errors resolved; codebase is robust and safe for novice coders.
- Updated documentation in README.md, info.md, and refactor plan to reflect these improvements.

## [0.4.2] - 2025-05-18
*Claude 3.5 Sonnet*

### Fixed
- Refactored all MCP server request handlers to use the correct parameter shape (`(request, extra)`), always accessing `request.params` as required by the MCP SDK.
- Updated `tools/call` handler to use `params.name` (not `params.toolName`), matching the SDK schema.
- Added robust type guards for all user input derived from Zod schemas, including `userContent.text` and `query`, to prevent `unknown` type errors and provide clear, actionable error messages.
- Improved code comments and structure for novice safety and maintainability.
- All TypeScript errors related to handler signatures and Zod type inference are now resolved.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-05-18

*Cascade (Gemini 2.5 Pro)*

### Changed
- Successfully integrated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` v1.11.4 using ES Module imports (`.js` extensions, direct paths to `server/index.js`, `server/streamableHttp.js`, `types.js`).
- Refactored server startup in `server.ts` to use Node.js `http.Server` for listening and initial request handling (authentication, `/healthz` route).
- `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` now correctly initialized (removed `port`, `addRoute`, `beforeHandle` options; set `sessionIdGenerator: undefined` for stateless operation).

### Fixed
- Resolved `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`, `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, and `SyntaxError` related to SDK module imports.
- Addressed TypeScript lint errors regarding `StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions` (`port`, `addRoute`, `beforeHandle`, missing `sessionIdGenerator`).
- Ensured server starts reliably after fixing `EADDRINUSE` port conflict issues.

- Fixed top-level await issue in server startup

### Removed
- Unused dependencies and imports
- Redundant type definitions
- ESM module imports in favor of CommonJS

## 2024-07-26 - Claude 3.5 Sonnet

- Refactored `server.ts` for compliance with MCP SDK v0.3.2:
    - Corrected SDK imports for `Server` and `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`.
    - Updated prompt and tool handler signatures to align with `(args: Record<string, unknown>) => Promise<PromptResponse | ToolResponse>`.
    - Reworked the `main` function to initialize `Server` and `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` instances once at application startup, rather than per-request.
    - Moved authentication logic into the `beforeHandle` middleware of the transport.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-05-27T23:28:16-04:00
*GPT-4.1 (Cascade)*

### Changed
- Updated `tools/call` handler in `server.ts` so that all tool call results always include BOTH classic `content` (array of text content parts) and `structuredContent` fields. This ensures compatibility with both unstructured and structured MCP clients. Added file/module-level comments explaining this MCP compatibility requirement.
- Registered `sober_thinking` tool, which reads the .env file (truncated values), and fully reads README.md and changelog files for the agent.

    - Configured the `/healthz` endpoint using `transport.addRoute()`.
    - Ensured `mcpServer.connect(transport)` is called once to link the server and transport.
- Integrated Zod for runtime argument validation and type safety in all prompt and tool handlers in `server.ts`:
    - Defined Zod schemas for `SoberThinkingArgs`, `FactCheckedAnswerArgs`, `BuzzkillArgs`, and `KillTripArgs`.
    - Implemented `safeParse` in each handler to validate incoming arguments.
    - Added error handling to return structured error messages if parsing fails, resolving previous TypeScript casting errors.
